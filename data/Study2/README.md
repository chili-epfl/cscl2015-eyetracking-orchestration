JdC2014 - An eyetracking dataset from facilitating a semi-authentic multi-tabletop lesson
=======================================================

This dataset contains eye-tracking data from a single subject (a researcher), facilitating three collaborative learning lessons in a multi-tabletop classroom, with real 10-12 year old students. These sessions were recorded during an "open doors day" at the [CHILI Lab](http://chili.epfl.ch).

This dataset has been used in several scientific works, such as the [CSCL 2015](http://isls.org/cscl2015/) conference paper "The Burden of Facilitating Collaboration: Towards Estimation of Teacher Orchestration Load using Eye-tracking Measures", by Luis P. Prieto, Kshitij Sharma, Yun Wen & Pierre Dillenbourg. The analysis and usage of this dataset is available publicly at https://github.com/chili-epfl/cscl2015-eyetracking-orchestration
